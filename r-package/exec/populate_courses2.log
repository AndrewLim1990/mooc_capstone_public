To convert from °C to kelvin (K), add 273 (or, to be more precise, add 273.15). 
K = °C + 273.15 
The answer you see above, [288,288.15],  means that the system will accept answers between 288 and 288.15, since it depends whether you used 273 or 273.15 in your calculation. Be sure not to use commas in your answer, or the system will give you an error. Use a period (.) for the decimal designation.
These two scales, Celsius and kelvin, are simply offset from one another.  Each one degree change in Celsius represents the same change in temperature as a one degree change in kelvin.  It's just that on the Celsius scale, 0 is defined as the freezing point of water, and on the kelvin scale, 0 is defined as absolute zero.

Wintertime air temperature at the South Pole is about -58°C. What is that temperature in Fahrenheit (°F)? (Enter a number)





Explanation
To convert from °C to °F, multiply by 9, divide by 5, then add 32
°F = (°C*9/5) + 32

Be sure not to use commas in your answer, or the system will give you an error. Use a period (.) for the decimal designation.

Warm tropical surface ocean temperatures are around 300 K. What is that temperature in Celsius (°C)? (Enter a number)





Explanation
To convert kelvin to °C, subtract 273 (or, to be more precise, subtract 273.15). 
°C = K - 273.15  
Again, the answer you see above, [26.85,27] just means that the system accepts answers between 26.85 and 27, since you might have used 273, or you might have used 273.15 in your calculation. Be sure not to use commas in your answer, or the system will give you an error. Use a period (.) for the decimal designation.

The Sun’s surface is about 6000 K. What is that temperature in Fahrenheit (°F)? (Enter a number.)





Explanation
To convert from kelvin (K) to Fahrenheit (°F), subtract 273.15, then multiply by 9, then divide by 5, then add 32
°F = (K-273.15)*9/5 + 32.  
With this equation, you should get 10340.33. Be sure not to use commas in your answer, or the system will give you an error. Use a period (.) for the decimal designation. The system will accept answers from 10000 to 10341, in case you ballpark estimated this one. 



Could not parse problem

The air temperature in my city in May averages about 56°F. What is that temperature in kelvin (K)? (Enter a number)





Explanation
To convert from Fahrenheit (°F) to kelvin (K), subtract 32, then multiply by 5, divide by 9, and last, add 273.15.  
K = ((°F-32)*5/9) + 273.15. 
If you use this equation, you'll get 286.483. Be sure not to use commas in your answer, or the system will give you an error. Use a period (.) for the decimal designation.

Water boils at 212°F. What is that temperature in Celsius (°C)? (Enter a number)





Explanation
To convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, first subtract 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9
°C = (°F-32)*5/9.



Could not parse problem

Earth’s global average temperature is about 15°C today. What is that temperature in kelvin (K)? (Enter a number)





Explanation 
To convert from °C to kelvin (K), add 273 (or, to be more precise, add 273.15). 
K = °C + 273.15 
The answer you see above, [288,288.15],  means that the system will accept answers between 288 and 288.15, since it depends whether you used 273 or 273.15 in your calculation. Be sure not to use commas in your answer, or the system will give you an error. Use a period (.) for the decimal designation.
These two scales, Celsius and kelvin, are simply offset from one another.  Each one degree change in Celsius represents the same change in temperature as a one degree change in kelvin.  It's just that on the Celsius scale, 0 is defined as the freezing point of water, and on the kelvin scale, 0 is defined as absolute zero.



Could not parse problem

Wintertime air temperature at the South Pole is about -58°C. What is that temperature in Fahrenheit (°F)? (Enter a number)





Explanation
To convert from °C to °F, multiply by 9, divide by 5, then add 32
°F = (°C*9/5) + 32

Be sure not to use commas in your answer, or the system will give you an error. Use a period (.) for the decimal designation.




Could not parse problem

Warm tropical surface ocean temperatures are around 300 K. What is that temperature in Celsius (°C)? (Enter a number)





Explanation
To convert kelvin to °C, subtract 273 (or, to be more precise, subtract 273.15). 
°C = K - 273.15  
Again, the answer you see above, [26.85,27] just means that the system accepts answers between 26.85 and 27, since you might have used 273, or you might have used 273.15 in your calculation. Be sure not to use commas in your answer, or the system will give you an error. Use a period (.) for the decimal designation.



Could not parse problem

The Sun’s surface is about 6000 K. What is that temperature in Fahrenheit (°F)? (Enter a number.)





Explanation
To convert from kelvin (K) to Fahrenheit (°F), subtract 273.15, then multiply by 9, then divide by 5, then add 32
°F = (K-273.15)*9/5 + 32.  
With this equation, you should get 10340.33. Be sure not to use commas in your answer, or the system will give you an error. Use a period (.) for the decimal designation. The system will accept answers from 10000 to 10341, in case you ballpark estimated this one. 



Could not parse problem

The air temperature in my city in May averages about 56°F. What is that temperature in kelvin (K)? (Enter a number)





Explanation
To convert from Fahrenheit (°F) to kelvin (K), subtract 32, then multiply by 5, divide by 9, and last, add 273.15.  
K = ((°F-32)*5/9) + 273.15. 
If you use this equation, you'll get 286.483. Be sure not to use commas in your answer, or the system will give you an error. Use a period (.) for the decimal designation.

Danny Miller and Isabelle le Breton-Miller researched the outstanding performance of numerous family firms. They concluded that family firms are different from non family firms in four ways. These “differentiators” often provided them with a competitive advantage. What are these four factors which set family businesses apart? (Hint: they all start with the letter C!)






























Explanation
What do each of these mean?
COMMAND: “take decisive action in the marketplace” 
CONTINUITY: “invest for the long run” ( rather then for quarterly earnings reports)
COMMUNITY: “unite the tribe” ( create a cohesive community of employees)
CONNECTION: “build close relationships with customers and suppliers”

Wendy discusses four principles of family systems theory and applies them to family business and the three circles within a family enterprise.  Select the four statements below that capture the essence of the four principles she discussed. 

Families and family systems tend to resist change to preserve the current state
Disruption in the business system doesn't directly impact the ownership system
Patterns, whether advantageous or harmful, repeat themselves generation after generation
Activity in any of the three circles can reverberate and impact any or all of the circles
Independence among generations is a common pattern
The whole is greater than the sum of the parts thus families and assets are stronger together

to address a pressing challenge that the family enterprise is facing
to bring in external consultants to manage the change and guide the family firm
to increase engagement within the family and non-family
to identify new values and vision to match the changes that are occurring
to have a special family meeting because families are more impacted than firms from change
to build trust, new capabilities, and capacities

Match each of the following definitions to their correct word.

Often associated with principles within a religious context


Values
Ethics
Morals


Typically associated with rules of a community or group (e.g., professional body)


Values
Ethics
Morals


Typically rule/guide for an individual, group or business


Values
Ethics
Morals




Explanation
You can have professional ethics, but you seldom hear about professional morals. Ethics tend to be codified into a formal system or set of rules which are explicitly adopted by a group of people. Thus you have medical ethics. Ethics are thus internally defined and adopted, whilst morals tend to be externally imposed on other people. Morals have a greater social element to values and tend to have a very broad acceptance. Morals are far more about good and bad than other values. We thus judge others more strongly on morals than values. A person can be described as immoral, yet there is no word for them not following values.

When most people think about entrepreneurship, they tend to associate it with risk taking, which in many ways is appropriate. However, entrepreneurship is much more than just taking risks (driving fast, on a windy road, on a dark, rainy night is definitely taking a risk, but it's not entrepreneurial!). In sharing a thoughtful definition of entrepreneurship, David wanted to emphasize the importance of what all successful entrepreneurs have in common, namely, the P_________ of O_____________.

Morals have a greater social element to values and tend to have a very broad acceptance. Morals are far more about good and bad than other values. We thus judge others more strongly on morals than values. A person can be described as immoral, yet there is no word for them not following values.

When most people think about entrepreneurship, they tend to associate it with risk taking, which in many ways is appropriate. However, entrepreneurship is much more than just taking risks (driving fast, on a windy road, on a dark, rainy night is definitely taking a risk, but it's not entrepreneurial!). In sharing a thoughtful definition of entrepreneurship, David wanted to emphasize the importance of what all successful entrepreneurs have in common, namely, the P_________ of O_____________. Because unless an entrepreneur has something worth going after, they are just a “risk taker” not an entrepreneur.

Step 0: (/ (* 3 4) (+ (- 7 4) 3))
   Step 1: (/ 12 (+ (- 7 4) 3))

Explanation
The second operand to / is an expression, so it must be evaluated. And the first operand to + is an expression, so it must be evaluated. All of the operands to - are values, so - can be called with 7 and 4 as arguments. This replaces the - call expression with 3.

Problem: Design a function that pluralizes a given word. (Pluralize means to convert the word
          to its plural form.) For simplicity you may assume that just adding s is enough to pluralize a word.
  	

    What is an appropriate signature for this function? Leave out the two semi-colons and the space, but
    otherwise be sure to get the capitalization and all other aspects of the signature correct.
  





Explanation
The most appropriate way to represent a word is with a string, so the primitive type the function should consume and produce is String. This means the signature line, including the semi-colons, is:
;; String -> String
 Note: type names should use upper camel case.

Is this self-referential type comment well-formed?
;; ListOfNumber is one of:
;; - (cons Number ListOfNumber)





Explanation
Although it has a self-referential case, it does not have a base case, so it is not well formed.



Could not parse problem

Is this self-referential type comment well-formed?
;; NonEmptyListOfNumber is one of:
;; - (cons Number empty)
;; - (cons Number NonEmptyListOfNumber)





Explanation
This is a type comment for a non-empty list - a list that at it's shortest just has a single element. It is well-formed because it has both a base case which has no self-reference: (cons Number empty), and a self-referential case: (cons Number NonEmptyListOfNumber).

Choose the part of the template that results from each highlighted part of the Type Comment.






Explanation
ListOfNumber has two cases, so we need a cond expression. empty is the first case, and it is atomic distinct, so the answer clause is (...).



Could not parse problem







Explanation
(cons Number ListOfNumber) is compound, so we separate it into two parts, the first being (first lon).



Could not parse problem







Explanation
The second part of the compound is (rest lon) which is ListOfNumber. This is a self-reference in the type comment, so (rest lon) is wrapped in a call to fn-for-lon to form a natural recursion.

The factorial of a natural number n is n*n-1*n-2*...1. So factorial of 3 is 3*2*1*1. Let's design a function called fact to compute the factorial.

factorial of 0 is 1
factorial of n is n*factorial(n-1)

Here is the signature and purpose for fact:
;; Natural -> Natural
;; compute n * n-1 * n-2 * ... * 1
What is the result of each check-expect?
(check-expect (fact 0) ____ )



(check-expect (fact 3) ____ )





Explanation
0 factorial is 1, so (fact 0) should produce 1. 
3 factorial is 3*2*1 whihc is 6.

After we run the program, we notice that one test in arrange-strings is still failing. Are we done working on layout-strings?






Explanation
We didn't complete the sorting part of this program, so that test for arrange-strings should fail. But since the tests for layout-strings are passing we are ready to move on to completing the rest of the program.

How many nodes do we have to look at in this BST to find the node with key 4? Include the node with key 4 in your count.






Explanation
First we look at the root, the node 3:c. It does not have the key 4. We go down the right subtree since the key we are looking for is greater than 3. Then we look at the node 4:d, and it has key 4 and we are done. So we looked at 2 nodes, 3:c and 4:d.

How many nodes do we have to look at in this BST to find the node with key 4? Include the node with key 4 in your count.






Explanation
To find key 4, we need to look at nodes 1:a, 2:b, 3:c, and then 4:d. So 4 nodes in total.

Suppose instead of producing the value of a node with a given key, we would like to 
    produce the path that we took when we searched for that key. So the function that we 
    would like to design should produce a list of "L" or "R", and should end with either
    "Fail" or "Succeed", depending on whether we found the key.
  

    We're almost done designing this function. We have the signature, purpose, tests,
    and we've even started filling in the template.
Drag the expressions below, into the appropriate box on the partially filled in template.

    You're still not comfortable with the idea that trees are layed out from above to below in computer 
    science, instead you would prefer to have your trees layed out left to right. So the root is at the 
    left, it's children are to it's right etc. For example, with your new version the result of 
    evaluating:
(render-bst (make-node 100 "C"
                       (make-node  50  "L" false false)
                       (make-node 150 "CL" false false)))
would look something like:




Again, that would look a lot better with a little extra whitespace in it, but please ignore that for now.
By remembering the role that combination positions play in templates, you realize that the new function definition should be very close to the old function definition. Edit the current render function definition so that it has the new left-to-right behavior by dragging one or more function names from the scrollbar below, onto the  function definition where you want to replace one function name with another.

Design the function has-path? that consumes a BinaryTree and a Path. The function should produce true if following the path through the tree leads to a node. If the path leads to false or runs into false before reaching the end of the path, the function should produce false.

;; BinaryTree Path -> Boolean
;; prodcue true if following p through bt leads to a node; false otherwise

Lets design a cross product of type comments table to help us write tests for this function. Note Nat, Str and BT stand for Natural, String and BinaryTree.

   p        bt  | false | (make-node Nat Str BT BT)
----------------|-------|----------------------------
empty           |       |            
----------------|-------|----------------------------
(cons "L" Path) |       |            
----------------|-------|----------------------------
(cons "R" Path) |       |            

Recall:

(define BT1 (make-node 1 "a" false false))
(define BT4 (make-node 4 "d"
                       (make-node 2 "b")
                                  (make-node 1 "a" false false)
                                  (make-node 3 "c" false false))
                       (make-node 5 "e" false false))) 
We need at least one check-expect for every cell in the table.

(cons "L" Path) | false | (has-path? <left-child> (rest path))
----------------|-------|--------------------------------------
(cons "R" Path) | false | (has-path? <right-child> (rest path))

How many cases can we reduce it to?





Explanation
The table can be reduced to these four cases:

                | false |      (make-node Nat Str BT BT)
----------------|-------|--------------------------------------
      empty     | false |                true
----------------|       |--------------------------------------
(cons "L" Path) | false | (has-path? <left-child> (rest path))

In the practice problem find-person-starter.rkt we asked you to use local to improve your functions performance as the tree gets larger. Would the following be a correct use of local for that purpose?

(define (find--lop n lop)
  (local [(define try (find--person n (first lop)))]
    (cond [(empty? lop) false]
          [else
           (if (not (false? (find--person n (first lop))))
               (find--person n (first lop))
               (find--lop n (rest lop)))])))





Explanation
In this case the local has not been moved to surround the nearest expression that encloses all occurrences of the repeated computation. That would be around the if. Instead it moved outside of the cond answer the if appeared in. Try running it with this definition and see what happens. Step it carefully to be sure you understand why.

Would this version that doesn't use local work?

         (if (not (false? try))
             try
             (find--lop n (rest lop)))]))





Explanation
The paramaters n and lop are not defined outside of find--lop, so this will not work either.

Explanation
To correctly identify the different study designs, be sure to pay attention to the number of groups being studied and the number of time periods. Starting from the left, the first study design has two groups and two time periods, making it a pre-post with control. The second has one group at two time periods, so is a pre-post (it does not have a control). Finally, the furthest right has two groups at one time point, so is a post-only with control study.

What is the total number of time points in the dataset?



At what value of data$time did you draw the abline indicating the start of the prior authorization policy?





Explanation
The dataset runs for 19 calendar quarters, from Q1 2001 quarter 1 to Q4 2005. As the prior authorization started at time point 8 in the dataset, the policy line is most appropriate placed between that and the next time point at 8.5.



Could not parse problem

 Which of the plots is consistent with a change in level following the policy change?





Explanation
Remember that a level change is an immediate drop in the outcome that is sustained over the post period. As the drop in Series 2 is abrupt and continues the pre-existing flat trend, it is representative of a level change.

Using the coefficients above, please estimate the predicted outcome at time point 20 (to two decimal places):





Explanation
At time point 20, you would calculate the predicted change as follows. First, the model prediction:
pred = B0*intercept + B2*time + B3*level + B4*trend
pred = 12.24 - 0.13*20 - 2.46 - 0.29*5 (remember that you are 5 time periods after the intervention!)
pred = 5.73


Now, calculate the counterfactual at the same time point:





Explanation
At time point 20, you would calculate the counterfactual by leaving off the level and trend change variables as follows:
cfac = B0*intercept + B2*time
cfac = 12.24 - 0.13*20
cfac = 9.64


Finally, use these two numbers to calculate the absolute predicted change be at time period 20:





Explanation
At time point 20, you would calculate the counterfactual as follows:
predicted change = pred - cfac
  = 5.73 - 9.64

Using the model coefficients, calculate how much higher water flow was predicted to be in the Nile in 1880 compared to the Huron, and enter your answer below:





Explanation
To calculate the expected difference in 1880, or at point 10, we can do the following calculation:
1. Expected level in the Huron = 2464.7702 + -20.2181 * 10 = 2262.5892
2. Expected level in the Nile = 2464.7702 + -20.2181 * 10 + 885.428 + 26.8242 * 10 = 3416.2592
Subtracting the first expected value from the second results in an answer of 1153.67.

pred = 19.6 + 0.13*25 + 1.4 + 0.04 * 25 + -0.14 + -0.3*10 + -4.36 + -0.5*10 (remember that you are 10 time periods after the intervention!)
pred = 12.75


Now, calculate the counterfactual at the same time point:





Explanation
At time point 25, you would calculate the counterfactual by leaving off the level and trend change variables as follows:
cfac = B0*intercept + B1*time + B2*leveldiff + B3*trenddiff + B4*levelchange + B5*trendchange
cfac = 19.6 + 0.13*25 + 1.4 + 0.04 * 25 - 0.14 - 0.3*10
cfac = 22.11


Finally, use these two numbers to calculate the absolute predicted change be at time period 25:





Explanation
At time point 25, you would calculate the predicted change as follows:
predicted change = pred - cfac
  = 12.75 - 22.11

What is your estimate for the level change after the policy change?




What is your estimate for the trend change?




Finally, compare your estimate for the level change to a model that doesn't account for the anticipatory effect. What is the difference between them (i.e. estimate with wild point minus estimate without wild point)?






Explanation
After accounting for the wild point, your model coefficients should be as follows:
level: -2.455
trend: 0.015
For the difference, a standard model fit without the wild point gives an estimate of -2.645, so
difference = estimate with wild point - estimate without the wild point
difference = -2.455 - (-2.645)
difference = 0.190

Finally, run your model again without the phase-in period and compare your estimate for the level change to this model. What is the difference between them (i.e. estimate with phase-in period minus estimate without the phase-in period)?






Explanation
For Item 1, your estimate for the level change should be −0.318.
For Item 2, your estimate for the trend change should be -0.021.
For Item 3, after removing the phase-in period from your model, your estimate for the level change should be 0.058. For the difference, calculate as follows:
difference = level estimate with a phase-in period - level estimate without a phase-in period
difference = -0.318 - 0.058

Using the model parameters, please calculate the predicted absolute change one year after the $1 copay (i.e. in July 1983) relative to the level and trend with the 3-drug-cap:






Explanation
To calculate the absolute change, you first use the fitted value from the final model at time period 43, which is 4.347. You then subtract from that the predicted value at the same time period, which you need to calculate using the first four beta coefficients from the model (remember your counterfactual is relative to the first policy at this point):

Using the model coefficients, please estimate the absolute change at 2 years after the phase-in period (i.e. in 2006, Quarter 4).






Explanation
The absolute change at 2 years after the intervention is calculated as follows:
1. First, use the predicated value from 2006Q4 from the model using the fitted values (remember that this is predicted value 23 not 28 as you have removed 5 lines from your dataset):
pred = 1.553
2. Second, calculate the counterfactual using the following formula:
cfac = B_0 + B_1*28
cfac = 1.501 + 0.026*28
cfac = 2.232
Remember that we have a phase-in period, so the baseline trend value is 28 at 2006Q4.
Subtracting these two values gives the estimated absolute change of -0.679.

To correctly identify the different study designs, be sure to pay attention to the number of groups being studied and the number of time periods. Starting from the left, the first study design has two groups and two time periods, making it a pre-post with control. The second has one group at two time periods, so is a pre-post (it does not have a control). Finally, the furthest right has two groups at one time point, so is a post-only with control study.

Using the model coefficients, calculate how much higher water flow was predicted to be in the Nile in 1880 compared to the Huron, and enter your answer below:





Explanation
To calculate the expected difference in 1880, or at point 10, we can do the following calculation:
1. Expected level in the Huron = 2464.7702 + -20.2181 * 10 = 2262.5892
2. Expected level in the Nile = 2464.7702 + -20.2181 * 10 + 885.428 + 26.8242 * 10 = 3416.2592
Subtracting the first expected value from the second results in an answer of 1153.67.

Using the coefficients above, please estimate the predicted outcome for the intervention group at time point 25 (to two decimal places):





Explanation
At time point 25, you would calculate the predicted change as follows. First, the model prediction:
pred = B0*intercept + B1*time + B2*leveldiff + B3*trenddiff + B4*levelchange + B5*trendchange + B6*levelchangediff + B7*trendchangediff
pred = 19.6 + 0.13*25 + 1.4 + 0.04 * 25 + -0.14 + -0.3*10 + -4.36 + -0.5*10 (remember that you are 10 time periods after the intervention!)
pred = 12.75


Now, calculate the counterfactual at the same time point:





Explanation
At time point 25, you would calculate the counterfactual by leaving off the level and trend change variables as follows:
cfac = B0*intercept + B1*time + B2*leveldiff + B3*trenddiff + B4*levelchange + B5*trendchange
cfac = 19.6 + 0.13*25 + 1.4 + 0.04 * 25 - 0.14 - 0.3*10
cfac = 22.11


Finally, use these two numbers to calculate the absolute predicted change be at time period 25:





Explanation
At time point 25, you would calculate the predicted change as follows:
predicted change = pred - cfac
  = 12.75 - 22.11
  = -9.36

What is the absolute predicted change in the market share for non-preferred agents in West Virginia at 6 quarters after the policy was introduced (as a proportion to 2 decimal places - e.g. 0.47)?






Explanation
To calculate the predicted value at 6 quarters after the policy change, first get the fitted values at time period 14. Remember there are 8 pre-policy quarters, and we are interested in 6 quarters after that, so 14 using fitted(). Then estimate the counterfactual at the same time point, and be sure to include the variables for the control group in your caluclations. Finally, calculate the absolute change at 6 quarters.

What is your estimate for the level change after the policy change?




What is your estimate for the trend change?




Finally, compare your estimate for the level change to a model that doesn't account for the anticipatory effect. What is the difference between them (i.e. estimate with wild point minus estimate without wild point)?






Explanation
After accounting for the wild point, your model coefficients should be as follows:
level: -2.455
trend: 0.015
For the difference, a standard model fit without the wild point gives an estimate of -2.645, so
difference = estimate with wild point - estimate without the wild point
difference = -2.455 - (-2.645)
difference = 0.190

Finally, run your model again without the phase-in period and compare your estimate for the level change to this model. What is the difference between them (i.e. estimate with phase-in period minus estimate without the phase-in period)?






Explanation
For Item 1, your estimate for the level change should be −0.318.
For Item 2, your estimate for the trend change should be -0.021.
For Item 3, after removing the phase-in period from your model, your estimate for the level change should be 0.058. For the difference, calculate as follows:
difference = level estimate with a phase-in period - level estimate without a phase-in period
difference = -0.318 - 0.058
difference = -0.376

Using the model parameters, please calculate the predicted absolute change one year after the $1 copay (i.e. in July 1983) relative to the level and trend with the 3-drug-cap:






Explanation
To calculate the absolute change, you first use the fitted value from the final model at time period 43, which is 4.347. You then subtract from that the predicted value at the same time period, which you need to calculate using the first four beta coefficients from the model (remember your counterfactual is relative to the first policy at this point):
Subtracting this from your predicted value gives the result of 1.251.

Using the model coefficients, please estimate the absolute change at 2 years after the phase-in period (i.e. in 2006, Quarter 4).






Explanation
The absolute change at 2 years after the intervention is calculated as follows:
1. First, use the predicated value from 2006Q4 from the model using the fitted values (remember that this is predicted value 23 not 28 as you have removed 5 lines from your dataset):
pred = 1.553
2. Second, calculate the counterfactual using the following formula:
cfac = B_0 + B_1*28
cfac = 1.501 + 0.026*28
cfac = 2.232
Remember that we have a phase-in period, so the baseline trend value is 28 at 2006Q4.
Subtracting these two values gives the estimated absolute change of -0.679.

Explanation
To correctly identify the different study designs, be sure to pay attention to the number of groups being studied and the number of time periods. Starting from the left, the first study design has two groups and two time periods, making it a pre-post with control. The second has one group at two time periods, so is a pre-post (it does not have a control). Finally, the furthest right has two groups at one time point, so is a post-only with control study.

For the difference, a standard model fit without the wild point gives an estimate of -2.645, so
difference = estimate with wild point - estimate without the wild point
difference = -2.455 - (-2.645)
difference = 0.190

What is your estimate for the level change in the percentage of youths prescribed an antidepressant after the FDA warning?




And what is your estimate for the trend change?




Finally, run your model again without the phase-in period and compare your estimate for the level change to this model. What is the difference between them (i.e. estimate with phase-in period minus estimate without the phase-in period)?






Explanation
For Item 1, your estimate for the level change should be −0.318.
For Item 2, your estimate for the trend change should be -0.021.
For Item 3, after removing the phase-in period from your model, your estimate for the level change should be 0.058. For the difference, calculate as follows:
difference = level estimate with a phase-in period - level estimate without a phase-in period
difference = -0.318 - 0.058
difference = -0.376

Using the model parameters, please calculate the predicted absolute change one year after the $1 copay (i.e. in July 1983) relative to the level and trend with the 3-drug-cap:






Explanation
To calculate the absolute change, you first use the fitted value from the final model at time period 43, which is 4.347. You then subtract from that the predicted value at the same time period, which you need to calculate using the first four beta coefficients from the model (remember your counterfactual is relative to the first policy at this point):
Subtracting this from your predicted value gives the result of 1.251.

Using the model coefficients, please estimate the absolute change at 2 years after the phase-in period (i.e. in 2006, Quarter 4).






Explanation
The absolute change at 2 years after the intervention is calculated as follows:
1. First, use the predicated value from 2006Q4 from the model using the fitted values (remember that this is predicted value 23 not 28 as you have removed 5 lines from your dataset):
pred = 1.553
2. Second, calculate the counterfactual using the following formula:
cfac = B_0 + B_1*28
cfac = 1.501 + 0.026*28
cfac = 2.232
Remember that we have a phase-in period, so the baseline trend value is 28 at 2006Q4.
Subtracting these two values gives the estimated absolute change of -0.679.

Explanation
To correctly identify the different study designs, be sure to pay attention to the number of groups being studied and the number of time periods. Starting from the left, the first study design has two groups and two time periods, making it a pre-post with control. The second has one group at two time periods, so is a pre-post (it does not have a control). Finally, the furthest right has two groups at one time point, so is a post-only with control study.

What is the total number of time points in the dataset?



At what value of data$time did you draw the abline indicating the start of the prior authorization policy?





Explanation
The dataset runs for 19 calendar quarters, from Q1 2001 quarter 1 to Q4 2005. As the prior authorization started at time point 8 in the dataset, the policy line is most appropriate placed between that and the next time point at 8.5.

 Which of the plots is consistent with a change in level following the policy change?





Explanation
Remember that a level change is an immediate drop in the outcome that is sustained over the post period. As the drop in Series 2 is abrupt and continues the pre-existing flat trend, it is representative of a level change.

Using the coefficients above, please estimate the predicted outcome at time point 20 (to two decimal places):





Explanation
At time point 20, you would calculate the predicted change as follows. First, the model prediction:
pred = B0*intercept + B2*time + B3*level + B4*trend
pred = 12.24 - 0.13*20 - 2.46 - 0.29*5 (remember that you are 5 time periods after the intervention!)
pred = 5.73


Now, calculate the counterfactual at the same time point:





Explanation
At time point 20, you would calculate the counterfactual by leaving off the level and trend change variables as follows:
cfac = B0*intercept + B2*time
cfac = 12.24 - 0.13*20
cfac = 9.64


Finally, use these two numbers to calculate the absolute predicted change be at time period 20:





Explanation
At time point 20, you would calculate the counterfactual as follows:
predicted change = pred - cfac
  = 5.73 - 9.64
  = -3.91

Explanation
To calculate the predicted value at 6 quarters after the policy change, first get the fitted values at time period 14. Remember there are 8 pre-policy quarters, and we are interested in 6 quarters after that, so 14 using fitted(). Then estimate the counterfactual at the same time point. Finally, calculate the absolute change at 6 quarters.

Trend difference: -0.00117
Level Change difference: -0.0351
Trend Change difference: -0.0129

Using the model coefficients, calculate how much higher water flow was predicted to be in the Nile in 1880 compared to the Huron, and enter your answer below:





Explanation
To calculate the expected difference in 1880, or at point 10, we can do the following calculation:
1. Expected level in the Huron = 2464.7702 + -20.2181 * 10 = 2262.5892
2. Expected level in the Nile = 2464.7702 + -20.2181 * 10 + 885.428 + 26.8242 * 10 = 3416.2592
Subtracting the first expected value from the second results in an answer of 1153.67.

Using the coefficients above, please estimate the predicted outcome for the intervention group at time point 25 (to two decimal places):





Explanation
At time point 25, you would calculate the predicted change as follows. First, the model prediction:
pred = B0*intercept + B1*time + B2*leveldiff + B3*trenddiff + B4*levelchange + B5*trendchange + B6*levelchangediff + B7*trendchangediff
pred = 19.6 + 0.13*25 + 1.4 + 0.04 * 25 + -0.14 + -0.3*10 + -4.36 + -0.5*10 (remember that you are 10 time periods after the intervention!)
pred = 12.75


Now, calculate the counterfactual at the same time point:





Explanation
At time point 25, you would calculate the counterfactual by leaving off the level and trend change variables as follows:
cfac = B0*intercept + B1*time + B2*leveldiff + B3*trenddiff + B4*levelchange + B5*trendchange
cfac = 19.6 + 0.13*25 + 1.4 + 0.04 * 25 - 0.14 - 0.3*10
cfac = 22.11


Finally, use these two numbers to calculate the absolute predicted change be at time period 25:





Explanation
At time point 25, you would calculate the predicted change as follows:
predicted change = pred - cfac
  = 12.75 - 22.11
  = -9.36

What is your estimate for the level change after the policy change?




What is your estimate for the trend change?




Finally, compare your estimate for the level change to a model that doesn't account for the anticipatory effect. What is the difference between them (i.e. estimate with wild point minus estimate without wild point)?






Explanation
After accounting for the wild point, your model coefficients should be as follows:
level: -2.455
trend: 0.015
For the difference, a standard model fit without the wild point gives an estimate of -2.645, so
difference = estimate with wild point - estimate without the wild point
difference = -2.455 - (-2.645)
difference = 0.190

Finally, run your model again without the phase-in period and compare your estimate for the level change to this model. What is the difference between them (i.e. estimate with phase-in period minus estimate without the phase-in period)?






Explanation
For Item 1, your estimate for the level change should be −0.318.
For Item 2, your estimate for the trend change should be -0.021.
For Item 3, after removing the phase-in period from your model, your estimate for the level change should be 0.058. For the difference, calculate as follows:
difference = level estimate with a phase-in period - level estimate without a phase-in period
difference = -0.318 - 0.058

Using the model parameters, please calculate the predicted absolute change one year after the $1 copay (i.e. in July 1983) relative to the level and trend with the 3-drug-cap:






Explanation
To calculate the absolute change, you first use the fitted value from the final model at time period 43, which is 4.347. You then subtract from that the predicted value at the same time period, which you need to calculate using the first four beta coefficients from the model (remember your counterfactual is relative to the first policy at this point):

Using the model coefficients, please estimate the absolute change at 2 years after the phase-in period (i.e. in 2006, Quarter 4).






Explanation
The absolute change at 2 years after the intervention is calculated as follows:
1. First, use the predicated value from 2006Q4 from the model using the fitted values (remember that this is predicted value 23 not 28 as you have removed 5 lines from your dataset):
pred = 1.553
2. Second, calculate the counterfactual using the following formula:
cfac = B_0 + B_1*28
cfac = 1.501 + 0.026*28
cfac = 2.232
Remember that we have a phase-in period, so the baseline trend value is 28 at 2006Q4.
Subtracting these two values gives the estimated absolute change of -0.679.
